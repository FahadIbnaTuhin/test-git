working directory -> Stagging area -> local repo. -> remote repo
test-project      ->    git add    ->  git commit -> git push

git init -- to initilize a git folder
git status -- what changes you have done whether it is tracked or untracked
              (you can use this inside working directory and stagging area)

stagging area
    git add text1.txt
    git add text.txt

    to add everything at the same time:
                git add .

    if you write something, that are untracked, you can see which thing is unchecked by this:
                git diff
        
    if you want to remove the untracted thing, then :
                git restore file_name
local repo. 
    -m represents message
    git commit -m "name, age is added"
    here, commit id is very important for version control

    to see all the commits that I have made:
        git log
